A descendant of the English Foxhound, the American English Coonhound is known for his speed and endurance. This athletic hound, which is capable of hunting raccoon and fox all night long, needs regular exercise to stay in condition. The American English Coonhound is sociable with humans and other dogs. The breed’s hard, protective coat needs little grooming.

Did you know
The American English Coonhound is a descendant of English Foxhounds, called Virginia Hounds, which were imported from England to the U.S. colonies in the 17th century by George Washington, an avid fox hunter. When trailing, these hounds have a distinctive “bawl,” or nonstop barking, that signals their enthusiasm and proximity to the prey.</p>
