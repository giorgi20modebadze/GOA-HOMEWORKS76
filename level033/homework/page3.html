One of the oldest Arctic sled dogs, the Alaskan Malamute was first bred in Alaska to carry large loads over long distances. A majestic, dignified breed, the Malamute is highly intelligent and learns quickly, but he also can be strong-willed. Loyal, devoted and highly athletic, he is an affectionate family companion that enjoys outdoor activities. The Malamute needs daily exercise, and his thick, coarse coat requires daily brushing and occasional baths.

The Alaskan Malamute was named after a native Innuit tribe called the Mahlemuts, who settled in Alaska.</p>
