            <h1>Standard</h1>
            <p>Standard motorcycles (also called roadsters, or naked bikes) are street motorcycles that conform to a stereotypical image of a motorcycle, with an exposed engine and fuel tank above it. Standard bikes typically have neither fairings nor windscreens as OEM attachments (hence the modern usage naked bikes).[6][11][12][13] With handlebars that are set neither high nor low, and footpegs neither placed forward nor "rear-set", standards give an upright rider posture (in-between the semi-recumbent cruiser and the forward crouch of a sport bike).[3] A standard's relationship between footpegs, handlebars and seat gives the rider a comfortable and natural posture.[2][6][3][4][9] The comfort, ease of control, and safety of standard bikes means that beginner motorcyclists inevitably learn to ride on them, and many experienced riders choose to continue riding this motorcycle type.[6]</p>

        <section id="Cruiser">
            <h1>Cruiser</h1>
            <p>Cruiser motorcycles (or simply cruisers) are styled after American motorcycles from the 1930s to the early 1960s, such as those made by Harley-Davidson, Indian, and Excelsior-Henderson.[6] Harley-Davidsons largely define the cruiser category, and large-displacement V-twin engines are the norm, although other engine configurations and small to medium displacements also exist.[6] Their engines are tuned for low-end torque, making them less demanding to ride because it is not necessary to shift as frequently to accelerate or maintain control.[14]

The riding position places the feet forward and the hands are up relatively high, so that the spine is erect or leaning back slightly.[6][3] At low to moderate speeds, cruisers are more comfortable than other styles,[3][4] but riding for long periods at freeway speeds can lead to fatigue from pulling back on the handlebars to resist the force of the wind against the rider's chest.[15] Cruisers have limited cornering ability due to a lack of ground clearance.[3][14]

        <section id="Touring">
            <h1>Touring</h1>
            <p>Although any motorcycle can be equipped and used for touring, touring motorcycles are specifically designed to excel at covering long distances.[6] They have large-displacement engines, fairings and screens that offer good weather and wind protection, large-capacity fuel tanks for long ranges between fill-ups, and a relaxed, upright seating position.[6] Passenger accommodation is excellent and expansive luggage space is the norm for this class.[6] Such bikes can have wet weights of 850–900 lb (390–410 kg) and top 1,300–1,400 lb (590–640 kg) fully loaded with a rider, passenger and gear.[14]

Bagger, full dresser, full dress tourer, or dresser are various names for touring motorcycles, sometimes used disparagingly or jocularly, and originally referring to a Harley-Davidson or other cruisers with full sets of saddlebags. This can now refer to any touring motorcycle.[14][22][23][24]</p>

        <section id="Sport">
            <h1>Sport</h1>
            <p>Sport bikes are road bikes that emphasize top speed, acceleration, braking, handling and grip,[3][5][25][26] typically at the expense of comfort and fuel economy in comparison to other motorcycle types.[6][9] Sport bikes have comparatively high performance engines supported within a lightweight frame. Inline-four engines dominate the sport bike category, with V-twins and parallel twins having a significant presence; and most other engine configurations appear in small numbers at times.[6] High-performance braking systems may use upgraded brake pads, multi-piston calipers and larger vented rotors.[6] Sports bike suspension systems may be more sophisticated, with greater adjustments for compression and rebound.[6] Sport bikes have fairings to completely enclose the engine, along with windscreens that effectively deflect the air at high speeds away from the rider, thereby minimising overall drag.[6]

Sport bikes may have footpegs that are both higher and set further back than on a standard bike, improving ground clearance when cornering and enabling a more prone position for the rider. There may be a long reach to the hand controls, which positions the body and center of gravity forward, above the fuel tank. The rider leans forward into the wind, the force of which may support the rider's weight at high speeds. However, at lower speeds a rider may experience excessive weight on the arms and wrists, causing fatigue.</p>

        <section id="Off-road">
            <h1>Off-road</h1>
            <p>Off-road motorcycles, also known as dirt bikes or scramblers, are specially designed for off-road use. The term off-road refers to driving surfaces that are not conventionally paved. These are rough surfaces, often created naturally, such as sand, gravel, a river, mud or snow. These types of terrain can sometimes only be travelled on with vehicles designed for off-road driving (such as SUVs, ATVs, snowmobiles and mountain bikes in recent decades, and minibikes even earlier) or vehicles are designed to better handle off-road conditions. Compared to road-going motorcycles, off-road machines are lighter and more flexible, typically having long suspension travel, high ground clearance, and are geared higher to provide more torque in off-road situations.[34] Wheels (usually 21" front, 18" rear)[citation needed] have knobby tires, often clamped to the rim with a rim lock.[6][35] [36] Many competitive events have emerged[when?] and developed into a variety of off-road motorcycle sports, for which a number of specialized motorcycles have been built
